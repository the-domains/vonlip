Hello, this is Filippo and I like to make companies successful online. 

This is my new personal blog, it includes news and facts from the tech indutry, tips and tricks for growing your userbase or simply your traffic, and some design stuff. 

If you find anything you are interested in leave a comment or simply subscribe to the newsletter. FYI, I hate spam as much as you do, so by subscribing you will only receive an email when there is a new article up.

So, I guess that's it, I hope you enjoy. 

PS: almost forgot, this website is made with TheGrid, the AI CMS which is in beta test at the moment. It wuold be great if you could send over some feedback if you find things not working properly. 

Cheers, 

Filippo
