<article style=""><h1>Airline Ski and Snowboard Baggage Policies</h1><p>Editor's Note: Flying with ski and snowboard bags sucks. It's expensive, they are heavy, and airlines lose them. Thanks for the full baggage policy from all airlines!

I found this amazing article on Teton Gravity, one of my favorite ski mags. They always publish rad stuff when it comes to skiing and the outdoors.

Anyway, the article sums up what are the best airlines to fly with if you have your ski stuff with you. Given that flying is always very expensive, it is useful to know the right carrier when traveling with all the gears.

I would have guessed that Canadian Airline was among the best companies, but I couldn't have guessed the others. Check the article to see all the specifics. 

Cheers, 

Filippo
